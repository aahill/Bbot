* What I Did This Summer
** Important Summer Accomplishments 
- Added to, debugged, and validated code ( although this will be an ongoing process).
  - Most important addition is an algorithm that automates the performance-wise ranking and crossing of a gen.
- Developed tractable hypothesis(es) and corresponding experiment(s).
- Ran and analyzed preliminary experiments (in simulation), confirming evolution is possible in our model, among other things.
- Collected and organized code into a comprehensable document that will facilitate validation and future additions

** Crossing Algorithm 
Designed an algorithm that crosses organisms based on task performance.
- Organisms are placed in pools of two with the top two performers in the highest pool, the next two in the second highest, etc.
- After orgs are crossed (starting with the highets pool) they are placed in successive pools for more chances to reproduce.
  - Result is top perfromers mate multiple times with potentially many different orgs
  
** Hypothesis  
Given the mutability of the distribution and number of crossover points, we propose the following hypothesis:\\ 

*** H_1                                                             :B_block:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_env: block
:END:
The distribution of crossover points influences the robustness of an organism's traits, and thus, is directly related to evolvability, fitness, and modualrity.\\

** Experiments 
I ran multiple simulated populations in order to verify that the model is sensitive to selection pressures.
- Selected for number of 'functional' threads.
- Altered a number of genomic parameters across populations to determine how they would affect selection. 
   
** Results

** Take Home 
- Adaptive evolution is possible 
- Due to many factors, including small population size,there is not much variation in the population
  - This is mitigated in part by a very high mutation rate (An order of magnitude larger than the default)
- Very high mutation rates are required because of the large amount of noncoding DNA
  - Likewise, more adding more crossover points did not affect performance significantly due to being distributed amongst noncoding regions.

:END:
 Possible experiment/I.V.: alter noncoding region size and see how fitness modularity are affected. 
* Next steps
** Next Steps 
- Firm up experimental parameters 
  - What does it mean for an org to be viable?
  - Max number of threads?
- Run populations in simulation with smaller non-coding regions (Is this more or less adaptive?)
- Complete/tweak experimental protocol
- Run experiments
